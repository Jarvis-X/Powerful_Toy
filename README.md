# Things to do

## VERSION ALPHA

    First: Output PWM generated by MCU to a pin. /Done

    Second: build a circuit to charge the capacitor. /Done

    Third: Control the Circuit of charging phase or launching phase. /Not yet, move to BETA version

    Forth: Add LEDs to indicating voltage with another PWM and ADC. /Done

## ALPHA END


## VERSION BETA
    
    First: House keeping. Delete unnecessary codes and, spare space.

    Second: Build a circuit controlling charging and launching phase.

    Third: Build an LED array showing voltage; find a not-currenting-consuming solution.
           (do not burn another MCU)

    Forth: Build a launching tube with coil.
   
## BETA END
